Mini Shell (Step 1) - Basic Command Execution

Build:
  make

Run:
  ./myshell

Supported:
 - External commands: ls, pwd, echo, grep, etc.
 - Builtins: cd, exit

Notes:
 - Parsing is simple whitespace splitting (no quotes handling yet).
 - This is Step 1. Add pipes, redirection, background later.
